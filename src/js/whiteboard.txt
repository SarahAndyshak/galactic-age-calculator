new Date() creates a new date object with the current date & time. 

function or prototype would need to collect current date and user's birthdate. 

Date object that seems most useful would need to deal with days.

-Need to know number of days until next birthday
-Need to know number of days in year on planet (already have prototypes and info)

Adapting from countdown timers, w3 schools:
// Get today's date and time
var now = new Date().getTime();

// Find the distance between now and the count down date
var distance = countDownDate - now;

Capture the current date without time using toLocaleDateString()

Next step: figure out how to get user inputted birthday.
